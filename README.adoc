# FSL Community BSP nxp-imx6-openrex
The manifest file is a list of the different layers that are needed for the NXP OpenRex community BSP release.

To get the BSP you need to have repo installed and use it as:

Install the repo utility:

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir fsl-community-bsp
$: cd fsl-community-bsp
$: repo init -u  https://github.com/Ghalgaoui/openrex-manifests.git -b kirkstone -m openrex.xml
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

$: MACHINE=openrex-imx6quad DISTRO=openrex-distro source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at fsl-community-bsp/sources.
